				        <p>
				        	A particular TRIIIBE photograph captured my attention over others, Equal Opportunity, 2011. This lenticular photograph is distinct from the rest and its message is one for discussion with anyone. Unfortunately it has yet to be seen in person with my own eyes but from Mary and Emily’s description I understand the functionality of the work. The photograph itself is displayed in a stand that vibrates the image, creating fluctuation between the subjects. Three pregnant teen girls changes before your eyes to three similarly dressed pregnant teen boys in this illusion. The process of creating this lenticular photograph is one I am unsure, but my curiosity makes me eager to hear more about it during Friday’s tour.
				        </p>
				        <p>
				        	The transforming subjects suggest that they are share something similar but indeed are different. The only thing that does not change with the image is the pregnant belly of each. It is not out of the ordinary to see a teen mom in today’s society, but the alternate subjects of the photograph may raise some confusion to its viewer. Since males are physically incapable of pregnancy, the photograph expresses that the alternating pregnant teens realistically do not share the actual pregnant belly but rather the pregnancy itself.
				        </p>
				        <p>
				        	It is much easier to identify a pregnancy in a teen girl rather than a teen boy because only the girl experiences physical changes, which are for the most part difficult to hide. Teen Dads or any Dad for that matter could walk the earth without substantially exposing the fact they impregnated a woman.  Unfortunately, this can make the possibility of escape or denial easier for men whether it is intended or innocent. if necessary, there are possible options for women to acclaim parental assistance, such as demanding child support or custody. These options may not come easily but they branch a whole other topic of discussion in themselves.
				        </p>
				        <p>
				        	The underlying message I removed from this photograph is one expressing the equal responsibility of both genders in a pregnancy, regardless of the physical adaptations. This photograph spurs various discussion topics, would men be more accountable in pregnancy if they were the ones carrying? If fleeing the pregnancy was an option for women would we see less mothers stepping forward? It is not that it is more socially acceptable for men to be absent or unaccountable in pregnancy than women, it is just farther recognizable in today’s society. When a woman becomes pregnant her life begins to change immediately whether she wants it to or not, a man does not receive as dramatic of a reality check. Unless the man involved with the mother during her pregnancy, his life does not have to change at all for about nine months. 
				        </p>
				        <p>
				        	The discussion could go on forever with the topic TRIIIBE’s photograph symbolizes. The impact that this photograph has is great. Initially the message seemed easily identifiable, and in a broad sense it was. This photograph does not only have one message though, there is a range of possible messages that can be immersed. It keeps you thinking.
