		When I look at “Golden Delicious” I think of greed and desire. The golden apples hanging from the man's coat represent that desire. It seems from the context of the photo that the man with the trench coat is most likely a street trader (back alley, graffiti on the walls) and odds are what he is selling is “hot” or illegal sold at a discounted price which is where greed comes into play. Some people are willing to do whatever it takes to have what they are after as well have it for little to no cost. The way the camera focuses on the man with the trench coat almost makes him more empowering looking up at him and belittles the others around him due to the fact he has what they want. He is also opening himself up more (by opening his arms and revealing what he has) which makes him seem bigger and much more empowered sort of like when bodybuilders flex they open their chest up more to appear bigger. The clothing of all the three characters stand out to me as for the man in the center has very nice leather clothes and a well kept face and appearance separating him from the other two characters who seem to be very dirty and most likely from a much more lower class, although what the man in the center does is a much less honest way of making a living than most. The trench coat is to hide what he is carrying from the naked eye and possibly from law enforcement and gives him a much less suspicious approach to carrying these items than a large bag or suitcase and standing on a street corner looking for potential customers. The golden apples represent something we all want and make these items much more desirable because of the affordable cost even but the cost of morals and guilt is included. The photo makes you ask yourself if what you want is almost worth it, are you willing to work for what you want and feel that gratitude and self accomplishment when you work hard for it and finally attain it, or take the easy way out and do something much less rewarding for a cheaper price just for the fact you have it. I also feel as though most items we desire are just material like items and not a necessity just a want.
