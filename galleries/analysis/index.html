        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <p class="blurb">Fitchburg State University students have taken a look into Triiibe’s artwork and try our best to make sense of the images in ways that pertain to our lives today. These analyses are extremely subjective to our own thoughts, but we hope that they are able to spark an important conversation in your lives as they did for us.</p>

									<a href="#" data-featherlight="jairo-hernandez-miss.html div">"Many times, we aspire to be like those who seem to have things under control, or to be doing something right. We all want to reach our goal, and at times the best way to do that is to learn from others by working towards a similar, if not the same goal. There’s always a process that we must go through in order to obtain the things we desire and the worst is when it turns out to be the opposite of what we expected. Even worse than that, is to believe that something is a certain way due to someone’s erroneous depiction of it. In the photograph Miss by TRIIIBE, the sisters are all dressed and crowned as if taking part in a Miss Universe type pageant; however, their sashes tell a very different story compared to how they appear."</a> - Jairo Hernandez

				        	<p>
				        		When I look at “Golden Delicious” I think of greed and desire. The golden apples hanging from the man's coat represent that desire. It seems from the context of the photo that the man with the trench coat is most likely a street trader (back alley, graffiti on the walls) and odds are what he is selling is “hot” or illegal sold at a discounted price which is where greed comes into play. Some people are willing to do whatever it takes to have what they are after as well have it for little to no cost. - Kevin Fitzmaurice
