		Many times, we aspire to be like those who seem to have things under control, or to be doing something right. We all want to reach our goal, and at times the best way to do that is to learn from others by working towards a similar, if not the same goal. There’s always a process that we must go through in order to obtain the things we desire and the worst is when it turns out to be the opposite of what we expected. Even worse than that, is to believe that something is a certain way due to someone’s erroneous depiction of it. In the photograph Miss by TRIIIBE, the sisters are all dressed and crowned as if taking part in a Miss Universe type pageant; however, their sashes tell a very different story compared to how they appear.

		In this image the three women are dressed very glamorously. They all have a tiara, and each is proudly displaying a sash. Normally, a sash tells the audience where the contestant is from and who they’re representing. In this portrait the sashes reveal a different truth about each woman. In my mind, it subliminally hints at the meaning behind the position they hold and the significance deep down. Far too often, we pay more attention and are distracted by what these women wear, their makeup, their hair, and even their performance. We don’t really stop to think about what the contestants are going through and what all this means for them as individuals; as well as those who wish to be like them. Imitation is huge, mainly within younger girls, and it greatly affects the way in which they think and act. They work towards being like what they see and tend to neglect important things in order to solely focus on representation. This can, and usually does, bring people to unexpected places.

		“Miss Lead” is in the center and seems to be the leading of the three. The spotlight appears to be shining just a little bit brighter on her and her other beautiful peers surround her. This is a very blunt way of showing how it doesn’t take much to distract and mislead us when surrounded by others believing the same illusion. Those who we most admire and look up to as role models can often lead us astray. We get lost in trying to become what we believe them to be and not the best that we ourselves can be. No two people are the same, so why try to make others fit into an impossible mold.

		“Miss Represent” stands confident and strong on the left, but just as her sash depicts, it might not necessarily be true. There are many individuals that we idolize whether it be athletes, models, artists, leaders, etc. that might stand for something very different than what we are led to believe. Blending in among the idols in our lives, which are advertised though many diverse mediums are those people who only show us the good parts. We see things we want to see that are appealing but not things as what they are. Not the truth. What benefits are there in that?

		“Miss Apprehension” can potentially be the most damaging of all. This is simply because it is not just the fact that we’ve been presented with the attractive side of something, but we are also driven along by what we believe it to be whether it is advertised as such or not. In this case it is not about the truth but about what we perceive the truth to be. This can lead us to make decisions and go down paths that we will most likely regret and surely hurt us in more ways than one.

		I chose to analyze this photograph because I was captivated by the way it uses women we tend to look to as the most beautiful, kind, talented, and respected to represent the negative effects that it can have on individuals. This is especially true for those that wish and aspire to be like them. This image impacts me because I look back and remember the many times either family members or I have watched shows, pageants, and competitions like this. There are things shown on the screen and stories shared with us about these women but the audience doesn’t always know the full story. I found it very interesting how TRIIIBE chose this approach to get viewers thinking much more deeply about the content and individuals that are presented to them in a very appealing and attractive way. This also applies to men.
