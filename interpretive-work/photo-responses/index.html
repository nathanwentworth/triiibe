        <h1>Student Photo Responses</h1>
        <p class="blurb">Inspired by TRIIIBE’s ability to provoke questions about controversial topics, Photography students from Fitchburg State University have decided to react to TRIIIBE: same difference. With their own images, these students call upon issues including social media, age, gender and identity.</p>

	        <div class="img-flex">

			        <div>
			        	<h2>"What makes a woMAN?" by Erin Murphy</h2>
				        <p>
				        	There are huge controversies in this world still about gender, and identity. I wanted to touch upon this because it is such a huge part of my life, but also a huge part of <b>TRIIIBE: same difference</b>. Every time I go out in public, I always get stares, as well as comments from strangers off the street. Some are sometimes good, but a lot of the time people are disgusted, just by the way that I look. Yes, I am a woman, but the way that I dress should not have to define that in any way shape or form. I wear mens clothing because it is what I feel most comfortable in, it is a way for me to express who I am without having to discuss it with anyone. I am who I am, the way that I dress is just a part of me, as is my gender. Clothing is a way for expression amongst your personal identity, and I wear my clothes proud.

			        <div>
			        	<h2>"Cookie Cutter" by Lindsey McGann</h2>
				        <p>
				        	In this image, I wanted to portray the beauty standards media and tradition has placed upon the shoulders of women. Our whole lives we have grown up with toys, symbols, and images that tell us we should look unhealthy and disproportionate, and that we need to fill gender roles, such as cooking. These kinds of stereotypes leave no room for individuality. The barbie wearing a shirt that says “be yourself” is in stark contrast of her likeness to the others, driving home this idea. Instead of being “ourselves” we are left trying to fit molds and become copies of the tall thin blonde “Barbie Girl” we idolized as children. I used the play on words “cookie cutter” to represent this in the setting of a kitchen.

			        	<h2>“Miss Imperfection” by Haylie Hier</h2>
				        <p>
				        	In this photo, I had the idea of portraying a girl who works so hard to achieve perfection. She’s wearing a sparkly elegant dress with her makeup done perfect all while chowing down on a copious amount of fast food. It doesn’t look right, does it? In my eyes, us girls are exposed to materialistic things and we all strive to be the perfect barbie doll that we all see on T.V. or in magazines…but in the end we realize that image we see everywhere isn’t reality... we’re only human and humans are far from being perfect.

			        	<h2>"Hands Tied" by Sara Prunier</h2>
				        <p>
				        	This image calls upon the topic of beauty standards in today’s society. The measuring tape around the wrists suggests that as a society our hands are tied. We are constrained by the false concepts of what is beautiful, how we should wear our hair, what clothes we should wear, and what size we should be. If we don’t fit these standards we are in some way lesser, which creates pressure to be perfect. We struggle to obtain this perfect image but in reality it doesn’t exist. We only hope to break these ties and start accepting others for who they are instead of scrutinizing and passing judgment on appearance.

			        	<h2>"Magic's In The Makeup" by Erin Murphy</h2>
				        <p>
				        	In this day and age many individuals wear makeup. However, some may use it as different means than others. Some may wear it to boost their self esteem, or enhance their look, and others may use it to mask their true identity, or change what they really look like. I chose to create an image that shows one side of the story, masking your true identity. I decided to have my model put makeup on half of his face, and then I drew a line down straight down the middle to show the side with and without makeup on. If you cover up half of the image you can tell that he looks like a different person overall. Makeup isn’t always something that you need to wear, you should find a way to wear as little as possible if not any to show the world who you really are. Looks aren’t always important, feel comfortable in your own skin, and show the world the real you.

			        <div>
			        	<h2>by Sara Prunier</h2>
				        <p>
				        	The most obvious interpretation of this image is that the use of social media in today’s society has almost reached the point of addiction. We have become so obsessed with the opinions of others and the immediacy of information that we are slowly being taken over by social media. The image depicts social media as a prescription drug; The intended function of this is, just like the use of prescription drugs, social media’s pay off depends on the individuals use of it. Prescribed medication is intended to benefit an individual and doesn’t always have to include the negative connotation of drug use. I believe that social media falls into a shade of grey. Yes, some people may overuse it, but others depend on social media for many things. Its a tool that allows people to stay connected with others, learn something new at the ease of a button or even create a career using it. Social Media shouldn’t have to come with a warning label to know that too much of a good thing can be bad.

			        	<h2>“A Man’s World” by Kelsey Kunigonis</h2>
				        <p>
				        	Public breastfeeding should not create the controversy that it does in today’s modern world. Segregating women or escorting her off a plane just because she has exposed her breast to feed her child is archaic. My photograph suggests that it is not an issue of breastfeeding but an issue of women versus men. If the roles were reversed and man was able to breastfeed, I believe that it would not be a controversial issue; there would be no “sexual” intent when seeing a man chest exposed. Being in the twenty-first century, it is definitely not motherhood breastfeeding in public but a sexual woman exposing herself that causes the controversy.

			        	<h2>"All Inked Up" by Erin Murphy</h2>
				        <p>
				        	In today’s society many people still have heated debates about tattoos and piercings; so I decided to do a little experiment and show the world something different. I photographed and digitally edited photos of a young boy having full sleeves and facial piercings to stir the pot a little and get your minds exploring places they haven’t been before. Nobody has ever seen tattoos and piercings on such a young child before, so this is just playing with the idea of children being able to do these things without parental consent in the world we live in today.  The reason I chose to put these tattoos and piercings on a young boy was also to express the idea of growing up too fast. Many kids nowadays are always searching for ways to grow up faster than they should be, childhood is something that goes too quickly and they should slow down and cherish the time they have to be young and free.

			        	<h2>by Lindsey McGann</h2>
				        <p class="indent">
				        My image is a composite of photos put together to create a single work. It depicts a woman holding a semi-visible mask made of words. On her own face one word is repeated: human. This concept can be perceived in two main ways.</p>
								<p class="indent">One suggests the woman is a public person or celebrity. The mask, holding both good and bad comments, depicts all the collective thoughts of who she is in the eyes of others. Her face mimics this with the word “human”. This represents the ability to be imperfect, make mistakes and be forgiven for all human-like attributes.</p>
								<p class="indent">The image could also represent the comments sent through social media. People often forget that the words they send behind a computer are going to another person. In this scenario the model represents both the sender and recipient, as media often goes both ways. The mask is the “face” that is given to her by the web, explaining who she is perceived as and who she portrays herself to be.</p>

			        	<h2>"We won’t do it" by Haylie Hier</h2>
				        <p class="indent">
					        When you take a modern day young woman and make her a 1950’s housewife this is what you get.  When you look at old advertisements of women in the fifties, they’re in kitchen, smiling, making pie and looking perfect. It looks too good to be true, right?  My idea was to take a modern day woman and put her in the same situation; as you can tell by her facial expression she isn’t enjoying it. Being a woman in today’s modern era, we all want to conquer the world by presenting ourselves as women did in the 1950’s; cleaning, cooking, taking care of the kids, looking perfect and being the great wife that she should be all while her husband is at work...but in reality it isn’t all that easy and sometimes impossible which is what I wanted my photo to come across as.
