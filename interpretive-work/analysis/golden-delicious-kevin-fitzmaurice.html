		When I look at “Golden Delicious” I think of greed and desire. The golden apples hanging from the man's coat represent that desire. It seems from the context of the photo that the man with the trench coat is most likely a street trader (back alley, graffiti on the walls). Odds are what he is selling is “hot” or illegal, sold at a discounted price, which is where greed comes into play. Some people are willing to do whatever it takes to have what they are after, as well as it is for little to no cost. The way the camera focuses on the man with the trench coat almost makes him more empowering; looking up at him belittles the others around him due to the fact he has what they want. He is also opening himself up more (by opening his arms and revealing what he has) which makes him seem bigger and much more confident. This is similar to when bodybuilders flex, they open their chest up more to appear bigger. The clothing of all three characters stands out to me. As for the man in the center, he has very nice leather clothes and a well-kept appearance. In contrast, the other two characters seem to be very dirty and most likely from a much lower class. However, what the man in the center does is a much less honest way of making a living than most. The trench coat is to hide what he is carrying from the naked eye and possibly from law enforcement. This gives him a much less suspicious approach than carrying these items in a large bag and standing on a street corner looking for potential customers. The golden apples represent something we all want which makes these items much more desirable. Because of the affordable cost, the expense of morals and guilt is included. I also feel as though most items we desire are just material items and not a necessity, just a want. The photo makes you ask yourself if what you want is worth it. Are you willing to work for what you want and feel gratitude and self-accomplishment when you finally attain it? Or take the easy way out and do something much less rewarding for a cheaper price just for the fact of having it.
