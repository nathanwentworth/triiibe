		I believe that Three Mil Plastic has many underlying messages throughout it. I’m no expert in photography; however, I do realize that everything is done deliberately to convey a message or to get the audience thinking. In more ways than one this photo has many messages to get the viewers thinking and talking about their own personal views and opinions. I believe that these are factors that great art exemplifies. A photograph that can be interpreted in many different ways without one specific right answer, but still get a conversation going is art worth seeing.

			Initially, at first glance, this photo can be interpreted as replica of one of Marilyn Monroe’s famous close up shots. This was my initial thought because of the blonde wig and bright red lipstick as she used to iconize. However, the big questions here to ask myself as a viewer would be - why is this beautiful woman wrapped up in plastic, or why does she look so sad? To me, this photo brings up many societal problems that our youth and teens are struggling with today. Being a girl who has grown up through the generation of such prominent media and forced ideologies of what we should look like, act like, and speak like, this image really speaks out to me in a way that some of the others couldn’t because I didn’t relate to them as much.</p>

			Taking the initial thought of this photo representing Marilyn Monroe, who was one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, you can imagine that what we are suppose to see is not an image of Marilyn but of what she used to represent: beauty, sex, lust. In many ways, we have a flawed media system. There are still some girls that aspire to be all the characteristics that I just listed and don’t even realize that it is actually important on what goes on beneath their makeup-concealed face. With this being said, I’m not trying to say that we shouldn’t take pride in the way we look, but the extremes that some go to reach an unattainable desire because of what they read in a magazine or from what they see in the media is just wrong.</p>

			The next message in this photo that really stood out to me would be the fact that her body is wrapped in plastic. Now this could have some relation to the Barbie aspect of our society or “the perfect woman”. Shows on TV nowadays idolize these women who replace their natural body parts with plastic just to “look better” or fit a certain image. Being the age I am now, my mind is able to grow my own opinions on these matters, however, the young viewers will be influenced by this and aspire to be just like them which is a problem that our society is facing now. If the plastic doesn’t represent Barbie or plastic surgery, the other take on it would be a more morbid view. The only time you see a body wrapped in plastic and is acceptable is when it is dead. She may physically look alive, but the way she feels inside, dead.</p>

			At the beginning of this analysis, I asked the question why does she look so sad? In many ways I think her facial expression represents how sad or dead her insides feel regardless of the way she looks on the outside. The title is called Three Mil Plastic, in many ways, we can assume she may even be a millionaire who is still unhappy regardless of the large sum of money she has access too. Many people need to realize that happiness is found on the inside of you. It won’t matter how much your diamond earrings cost, or how you wear your hair that day. You might get attention that you were initially looking for, but that won’t last. The attention you deserve comes once you realize that what you believe and think matters more than what you look like.  Chasing a specific image just because that is what society told you to be doesn’t make you feel better about yourself. Look good for yourself and for the right reasons, but don’t chase images just because the media and popular culture tell you to. </p>
		<p>	As a viewer of this photo, just imagine if it was a male wrapped in plastic, instead of a woman. I believe that many people would come to the conclusion, rather quickly, that the man in the photo was dead. I think that due to the fact that Barbie’s and plastic surgery aren’t very synonymous with men in our society today. Negative attention and connotations about sex, lust, and beauty will follow us wherever we go, especially as women. These double standards need to be put to an end, therefore, we need to make sure that we feel good on the inside before we succumb to the societal issues of being accepted.</p>
