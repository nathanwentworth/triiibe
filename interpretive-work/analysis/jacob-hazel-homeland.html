		From the outset, TRIIIBE has used their identical looks to play with the concept of identity in an eye opening way. When you have three people you know to be similar looking actually be so different, not only does it make you uncomfortable, but also it makes you aware of what identities they adopt really that really don’t seem to fit them. With that being said, the reason some of these identities don’t fit makes you step back and think.

		What I’m talking about is gender norms. When you see a member of TRIIIBE dressed as a man, with her sisters in more conventional dress, it points out your gender conventions. No matter how convincing their dress and makeup, when you see a man dressed as a woman, or a woman dressed as a man, you can usually tell. But what TRIIIBE is trying to get across is that it shouldn’t matter the gender. You should be able to dress how you want without judgement from your peers. There shouldn’t be “dressing as a man” or “as a woman”, but rather just dressing. And this idea is present in the work, along with others, in the work I’m analyzing today: Homeland.

		To me, this particular work leans into TRIIIBE’s main ideas more than any other that I’ve seen in their portfolio. To start, they present the basic idea of different possible identities for different people in the different ways that they dress. For starters, there’s the demure 50’s housewife sitting in the center, so self contained that she isn’t even looking at the camera. Then we have the 50’s husband to complete the set, with his traditional, serious, all beige getup. And of course, it’s the 50’s and the United states at this point is moving from major conflict to major conflict, so beyond the two of them is the military man dressed in mid 20th century fatigues, completing the picture. Dress is such an important part of our identities and the way we dress makes others assume many things about us. I assumed an era, and personalities from the way the actors in this piece dressed. Maybe some of those assumptions were not essientally what the artists were trying to convey, however, TRIIIBE is excellent at making you fall for assumptions. This is one reason this particular piece works so well.

		Another important part of the piece is the era it’s set in. The 1950’s is a time some look back on with nostalgia. “A simpler time”. “People respected each other then”. Rose colored glasses can only go so far. The era was good for men. Not so much for women. This would make an excellent target of criticism for a group like TRIIIBE. They are a group that is great at pointing out inequalities through identity. Look at the housewife. She’s below the husband, not even looking at the camera. Is this because the military figure in the photograph has passed away? Are they just away overseas or have the army men already come to the house to break the news? The wife reacts how a wife in the 50s would have been expected to. Whatever the news, she sits there silently and self-contained. The husband stands above, silent, comforting the wife, but firmly, laying hands is a familiar, masculine gesture. He is looking at the camera, almost challengingly. Not a very shy way to present yourself. And the person in the photograph acts the same way. Sitting there, similarly stoic and unflinching.

		One of TRIIIBE’s favorite ways of playing with identity is playing with genderidentity. The era makes for good fodder for that. Dressing one woman in “period appropriate” clothing only highlights the differences between her and her sisters dressed as men. It almost begs us to point out “that’s not how people dressed back then”. It really forces us to examine our prejudices. It’s arresting, once we look at the whole piece and then have to look at ourselves after, realizing what they are saying with the piece.

		The last major component of the photograph is that of its commentary on gender. TRIIIBE is most cleverly baiting us into saying that’s not right something feels wrong about the manner of dress. It’s hard to even describe the women in the photograph because when we see these people clearly meant to represent the opposite gender our language fails to provide appropriate words. Should I call the husband in the photograph a man? Or should I call him a woman? Because, after all, it is a woman dressed as a man. Should I even say that? Should there be appropriate ways for men and women to dress? It all gets quite confusing. But that’s the point. TRIIIBE wants to point out the problems we have when gender roles become fluid, that we can’t even talk about it because our language doesn’t even fit fluidity of genders.

		This photo is excellent at pointing out the problems with gender today as it stands by using the past. If we can look at this photograph and see the gender norms and be okay with them, it proves we still have room to grow as a society. By putting themselves in the shoes of different actors in the backdrop of the 1950’s we see why gender roles can be harmful. People want to be who they are. Even when society frowns upon it.
