		In my opinion this portrait represents the hardships and discouragements of Latinos in the United States workforce. Particularly the ones who travel from Mexico to the United States working on fields in order to send money back home to their families with increased value. Sadly the money they make is still not enough to afford some of the world’s luxuries, including fresh food. Royal Gala shows even though they are working to provide the general public with quality produce, they themselves can’t afford the produce itself. It’s also conveys a feeling of depression, when I look at this photo it reminds me that many people are still living a “Great Depression” like the one of the 1930s. I remember John Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath”, and how one could hope for a new life in the fields of California, much like these unfortunate souls. It makes me feel fortunate that I can work and afford to buy quality food and that I grew up into a family that can live a modest and equal life aside the rest of the world. It makes me wonder why life can’t be better in Mexico for these people. Why can’t Mexico build itself to be a prosperous nation like the United States? If life in Mexico was of better quality, the people would be able to work and support their families. I also think about the quality of fast food and how it’s cheaper because of the low nutritional value and cheaper ingredient. Much of American obesity can be blamed for the bad economy and fast food. The apples behind the subjects are much healthier  than fast food. Quality is a key word for me in this portrait, just looking at the clothing worn by these subjects for example; it is very dirty, and has not been washed because lack of access to a clothes washers. You can see that they themselves haven’t washed down, one of them has very dirty hands and they all have greasy hair. I feel like I’d be able to understand more about this photo if I were able to relate to these persons. Although it can be said that these people are actually trying and working to make money, unlike some others who can be found searching for handouts on the streets.
