		In my opinion this portrait represents the hardships and discouragements of Latinos in the United States workforce. Particularly, the ones who travel to the United States working on fields to send money home to their families with an increased value. Unfortunately the money they make is still not enough to afford some of the world’s luxuries, including fresh food. Royal Gala shows even though they are working to provide the general public with quality produce, they themselves can’t afford the produce.

		This setting also conveys a feeling of depression. When I look at this photo it reminds me that many people are still living a “Great Depression” like the one of the 1930s. I remember John Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath”, and how one could only hope for a new life in the fields of California, much like these unfortunate souls. It makes me feel fortunate that I can work and afford to buy quality food. In addition I grew up into a family that can live a modest and equal life aside the rest of the world. It makes me wonder why life can’t be better for these people. Why can’t some countries like Mexico build itself to be a prosperous nation like the United States?

		If life in these countries was of better quality, the people would be able to work and support their families. I also think about the quality of fast food and how it’s cheaper because of the low nutritional value and cheaper ingredient. Much of American obesity can be blamed for a bad economy and fast food. The apples behind the subjects are much healthier than fast food. Quality is a key word for me in this photo. Just looking at the clothing worn by these subjects is a great example, it is very dirty and has not been washed because lack of access to a clothes washer. You can see that they themselves haven’t washed down with one of the subjects having very dirty hands and they all have greasy hair.

		I feel like I’d be able to understand more about this photo if I were able to relate to these persons. Although it can be said that these people are actually trying and working to make money, unlike some others who can be found searching for handouts on the streets.
