		Abstinence Eve depicts a woman being fitted with a chastity belt by two nuns on their knees. Above her is a variety of belts adorn with American flags and other symbols. The image appears to have elements that comment on politics, religion, and women’s right. The photo has a triangular composition, which is used in religious art throughout history.

		The first thing you see in the photo is the woman in the center. This is because her face is lit most, making her stand out. Then your eyes travel to her sides and see the two nuns tugging at the belt places around her. The nuns look up, almost in a maternal guiding way. The center woman seems unsure, where the devout nuns appear at peace with what is happening. The belts themselves are like characters themselves. Each has a “personality”. Each is embellished with a flag, heart, and/or star and hangs from the ceiling by chains.

		The center woman appears young in age. I get that idea from the hairstyle of pigtail braids and the plain white undershirt and underwear. Older women typically do not braid their hair in that style and undergarments get more expressive and sexual as women age. She reaches for the belt with a heart. This is obviously a thought provoking gesture that makes me think of the idea of “waiting till you’re in love”. In other words, hold onto your virginity till you have met the “right one”… the only one.

		As a girl, you are taught your virginity is something important. In some cultures a virgin woman is a valuable commodity and there are jobs titled, virginity checkers who make sure these women stay “virtuous”. In America, the idea of virtue, purity, and virginity persists, but not to that extreme. You see this with father/daughter balls in which the young girl promises her father to save her virginity for her husband and the father presents her with a purity ring. The problem with the obsession with virginity in any culture is it sexualizes young girls way too early in life.

		The truth is, virginity is a grey area. How can you tell if a female is a virgin? You could take her word. Or check for a hymen. One problem, a hymen can be torn from something as simple as jumping on a trampoline or horseback riding. Ok, how about the fact she bleeds after sex? Recent research concluded that if a female is relaxed and doesn’t strain her vaginal muscles during the first time having intercourse she might not bleed. The blood comes from the tension and anticipation of the act and not the act itself. You tell a girl it will hurt and she will bleed and it will happen.

		The religious element of this photo is established with two nuns. Nuns are women who have given up the worldly pleasures to be married to God. They are abstinent and find sexuality as a vulgar act (unless it is just for the use of procreation). I have had plenty of exposure to devout Catholic nuns as a child while going through catechism. They don’t just live the virtuous life, they advocate for it. The title also has a religious element because it references Eve. Eve had no control and couldn’t help but eat the apple. Does that mean all women have trouble resisting? Is the belt intervention for her own good?

		The flags make it obvious that it is commenting on the American obsession with virginity. After looking at their sketches and outtakes (through their TRIIIBE website) I was able to ascertain that President Bush was an influence on this photo. During his time in office there was this Christian wave of ideals that penetrated DC. Some of which still lingers and is prevalent in issues regarding women’s health/rights, evolution/creationism education in schools, and the support of the arts. Feminists consider Bush’s time in office as the one step back regarding women’s rights in this Free Nation.

		Consequently, Abstinence Eve is a provocative multifaceted image that seems to dabble in women's issues, politics, and religion. It is classically composed with a triangular composition that gives you directionality and visual unity. The way I have pulled apart the meaning of it, may differ from someone else with a different background, gender, cultural, etc. but the idea behind it is not nailed down. This image is meant to make you ask questions and it left me with many questions to think about.
