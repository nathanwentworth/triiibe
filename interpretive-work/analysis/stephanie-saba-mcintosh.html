		After looking through TRIIIBE’s photo collection, I decided to analyze their work “McIntosh” from the series “In Search of Eden”. I was drawn to this photo because of the many different layers within the piece and the different statement it manages to make with just a still picture. The piece combines religious aspects with an underlying statement on society today and its reliance on technology. The photo portrays a large tree made up of wires and Ethernet cables with apples hanging off; the triplet sisters are immersed in the tree and I associate their look and stance to that of the Greek women and goddesses. The work is presented in a triptych; this is done to evoke a religious feel, much like the large paintings in a church. The format of the Triptych is just one-way TRIIIBE displays religious themes in their work.

		“McIntosh: In search of Eden” is clearly influenced by the bible story of Adam and Eve and the Original Sin. The Tree of Knowledge holds the forbidden fruit that Adam and Eve are told by God not to eat under any circumstances; as we all know Eve succumbed to temptation and ate the apple, leading to her and Adam’s banishment from Eden. TRIIIBE does a very modern and relevant take on this story with “McIntosh”. Most notably is the tree, which is the forefront of the work. Here it is made up of cable wires in order to represent technology and the knowledge that comes with it. At the end of the “branches” are McIntosh apples, directly referencing the Apple Company who is known for its large advances in technology. I find the work to be making a statement on the impact that technology has; of course it has countless benefits but perhaps all this knowledge is negative, just like it was in the Bible story. This tree of “knowledge” has begun to have negative impacts on society; People are lacking in social skills and personal connections, children are beginning to think and learn differently, and people’s privacy is put at extreme risk. Facebook is a big example of this problem as a study has shown people are becoming isolated and depressed when looking at other’s lives through a screen. This is depicted in the photo through the tree’s location. Looking closely I found that the tree is in what appears to be a room, you can see the walls on the side. However, there is a large window with a beautiful sunset view making onlookers believe the tree is outside. Facebook makes you believe you are a part of the outside world, you can contact all your friends and let everyone know what you are doing at all times, in reality you are simply behind a computer screen isolating yourself from the outdoor community.

		Another large factor of the art piece is the three TRIIIBE sisters, jutting out as a part of the tree. They appearance is ethereal, their pose is delicate and the look similar to images of Greek goddesses as they are draped in the wires like togas. Going back to religion, 3 would be considered an important and sacred number. To me, I am reminded of the three fates. In Greek mythology they are considered the spinner, the measurer, and the cutter of the thread of life. TRIIIBE may be trying to show a connection between the amount of technology and the quality of one’s life. Each of the fates seems to be holding an apple, symbolically handing you a life of knowledge. With that knowledge comes the responsibility to use it correctly and wisely. I believe this work makes a profound statement on technology and how it has come to rule our society and may even lead to the downfall of it, much like the apple did for Eve. I find this to be an enlightening and refreshing piece to analyze, as I have always been skeptical of the advances technology has made. I think in this day and age technology is doing more harm than good and it is frustrating to see how people, including myself, succumb to the facade of convenience it has. TRIIIBE did an excellent job in saying what I could not put into words and took a creative leap in comparing technology with religion.
