		Pink Lady is a photograph by TRIIIBE that takes a look into the ideas of body image and the way we see ourselves throughout life. It touches on the aspect of our lives of wanting to be accepted and fit. There’s no question that it feels good to be part of something bigger than ourselves, however, we all need to realize that we are all different. Our expectations of perfect, will not always be the same as someone else’s.

		When you look at the image, the Barbie doll in the middle of the photo catches your eye. On the sides of that middle image is where we see two different perspectives of trying to fit into that Barbie lifestyle. Throughout our society, we are constantly given subliminal messages of what we should look like or act like. With that being said, our minds aren’t all operating the same way and interpreting these messages identically. As we grow older, our perspectives often change too. In many ways, this tryptic photo could be viewed as stages of a girl’s life.

		When I viewed this photo, I initially believed that this was two different girls trying to fit into the parameters of society today, but as I look deeper, I believe that the left side of the photograph may very well be the younger version of the girl on the right. Sure, when at a young age, most girls idolize the Barbie doll and want to be just like her with the perfect clothes, body type, and even hair. When you look to the left of the photograph, you will notice that she has Barbies laying all around her room, just as a young girl would. There is also an apple that is cut up, which goes along with the Search of Eden exhibit that TRIIIBE is presenting, however, I believe the placement of the fruit into this side of the picture was deliberate due to the way the fruit is cut in such a way that would make you assume that the girl is young and her caretaker gave her that snack. Her expression in the photo is happy in a simplistic kind of way, due to the fact that the majority of the time, life at this age is simple.

		What is interesting about this photograph, is that the wallpaper in the background never changes, even when you look at the middle section. Initially, I believed that the image in the middle, would have just been an example of a Barbie representing the unobtainable aspects of life, but because the wallpaper doesn’t change, it makes me think that this section represents the middle stage of the young girls adolescence. Peer pressure is something that everyone experiences in one way or another. I believe that as the young girl on the left grew older;  she did everything she could to become that Barbie-like figure that she aspired to be since such a young age. You’ll also notice the stiff, fake nature of the girl in the middle. I believe that image represents the way this girl felt throughout this time of her life. Trying to fit an image that really isn’t who you are just because it’s what society might tell you “perfect” looks like, doesn’t mean that you should lose who you really are to become this.

		The final frame of this photograph, if you view it in stages, would be the right side showing the older looking girl. It is my belief that the girl on the right represents the darker aspect of life that comes once you realize you’re done pretending to be someone you’re not. Doing everything in your power to try to fit into a society that will probably just find another reason to tell you you’re not good enough can be exhausting after a while. I believe that the girl on the right shows us the reality of life. It is not always going to be pretty and pink; and bad things do happen. As we grow up, our innocence goes with us more often than not and we become less naive. There is nothing wrong with the girl on the right; she just wants to be herself. She still holds onto the desire to fit in, you can see this with the new pink rug, and even her new attire that better fit her personality as she grew up. We are all different in our own ways, and we should embrace those differences because that is what makes the world interesting today. Don’t lose yourself while trying to fit into an unrealistic image.
