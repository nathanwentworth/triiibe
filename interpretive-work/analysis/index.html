				        <p>
									"Abstinence Eve depicts a woman being fitted with a chastity belt by two nuns on their knees. Above her is a variety of belts adorn with American flags and other symbols. The image appears to have elements that comment on politics, religion, and women’s right. The photo has a triangular composition, which is used in religious art throughout history." - Anna Farwell

				        <p>
									"In my opinion this portrait represents the hardships and discouragements of Latinos in the United States workforce. Particularly the ones who travel from Mexico to the United States working on fields in order to send money back home to their families with increased value. Sadly the money they make is still not enough to afford some of the world’s luxuries, including fresh food." - John Rezuke

				        <p>
									"From the outset, TRIIIBE has used their identical looks to play with the concept of identity in an eye opening way. When you have three people you know to be similar looking actually be so different, not only does it make you uncomfortable, but it also makes you aware of what identities they adopt that really don’t seem to fit them. With that being said, the reason some of these identities don’t fit makes you step back and think." - Jacob Hazel

			        	<h2>McIntosh</h2>
				        <p>
									"After looking through TRIIIBE’s photo collection, I decided to analyze their work “McIntosh” from the series “In Search of Eden”. I was drawn to this photo because of the many different layers within the piece and the different statements it manages to make. The piece combines religious aspects with an underlying statement on society today and its reliance on technology. The photo portrays the triplet sisters immersed in a large tree made up of wires and Ethernet cables with apples hanging off. I associate their look and stance to that of the Greek women and goddesses. The work is presented in a triptych. This is done to evoke a religious feel, much like the large paintings in a church. The format of the Triptych is just one way TRIIIBE displays religious themes within their work." - Stephanie Saba

				        <p>
									"Many times, we aspire to be like those who seem to have things under control, or to be doing something right. We all want to reach our goal, and at times the best way to do that is to learn from others by working towards a similar, if not the same goal. There’s always a process that we must go through in order to obtain the things we desire and the worst is when it turns out to be the opposite of what we expected. Even worse than that, is to believe that something is a certain way due to someone’s erroneous depiction of it. In the photograph Miss by TRIIIBE, the sisters are all dressed and crowned as if taking part in a Miss Universe type pageant; however, their sashes tell a very different story compared to how they appear." - Jairo Hernandez

			        	<h2>Golden Delicious</h2>
				        <p>
									When I look at “Golden Delicious” I think of greed and desire. The golden apples hanging from the man's coat represent that desire. It seems from the context of the photo that the man with the trench coat is most likely a street trader (back alley, graffiti on the walls). Odds are what he is selling is “hot” or illegal, sold at a discounted price, which is where greed comes into play. - Kevin Fitzmaurice

			        		“Maybe we weren’t supposed to see Marilyn, but everything she once represented. As a common sex symbol of the 1950s, maybe we are supposed to realize that she is representing all those things - sex, lust, beauty, unattainable happiness. … Negative attention will follow us wherever we go, especially as women, these double standards need to be put to an end, therefore, we need to make sure that we feel good on the outside before we succumb to the societal issues of being accepted” - Kimberly Tecce
