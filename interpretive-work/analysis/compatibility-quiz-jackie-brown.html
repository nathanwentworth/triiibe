		This photograph, like other works of TRIIIBE, effectively represents what they stand for: same difference. The photo captures the three identical sisters, dressed as three differing female roles in society posing at a bar. It is clear that one fits in more than the other two, but why are we conditioned to acknowledge that? Why do we correlate appearance with character? We may assume that the middle woman who is dressed professionally does not get drunk at the bar and leave with men, but we may be more likely to assume so for the left sister, who is dressed more provocatively.

		The three women assumingly came to the bar with the same intent as any accompanied customer, to buy some drinks. The probability of them being treated similarly though, is unlikely.  We would assume the daringly dressed woman on the left would be approached by men more so than the far right woman, whose appearance seems more intimidating. Clothing is typically worn to show individual expression, but it is society’s interpretation that is problematic. Regardless of the attire, the customer at the bar should always be attended to like any other. Of course there is no proof in this photograph to show otherwise, but TRIIIBE is making a statement that can be easily determined by their audience. It is something everyone in society is guilty of, whether we admit to our judgments or not.

		When analyzing this photo, it made me think of relatable scenarios in my life. Although the scenarios are not as bold as the statement made here by TRIIIBE, I regularly see the refusal, discomfort, and anxiety of men in a setting that targets women customers. I work at Victoria’s Secret PINK as a sales associate, so my job is to help better the customer's shopping experience to my best ability. If you aren’t already aware, PINK is an apparel store that sells women’s clothing, bras and panties. It comes to my surprise when the man agrees to accompany the female into the store rather than the usual man impatiently waiting at the entrance. It is the male children who really express their emotion towards the experience when their mom forces them to come in, screaming “I don’t wanna go in this girl store, ew!”  Even the male customer who comes alone to shop for his special someone displays anxiety.

		An occasion in particular struck the realization that I had been guilty of prejudice behavior and conform to social norms. I assumed a particular lifestyle based on the appearance of the person.  I approached a male customer who was shopping alone. I assumed, the man who was dressed professionally, in a button up shirt, black dress pants, and polished black dress shoes, was stopping by the store on his way home from work to pick up a gift for his girlfriend or wife. I walked up to him expecting to answer a question he was probably embarrassed to ask, like any other male customer I have assisted. It came to my surprise that this male was actually shopping for himself, and he confidently requested hot-pink short-shorts. At first, I hesitated because I assumed it was a joke, but he was very much serious. I was able to get him what he asked for and he left happy.

		A few other girls who I was working with that day laughed about it and made comments such as, “that was so weird” and “must be some freaky fetish of his or something.” I will admit, I laughed along with them and was just as taken back about it but it also made me think: if the other girls were to assist him, would they have been able to make him feel as comfortable as I did? I was wrong for assuming he was the typical business man that was shopping for the special woman in his life. But I am proud that I accepted the situation when it became known, treated him with respect and helped him with what he was looking for.

		TRIIIBE’s "Compatibility Quiz" communicates a similar message to what I learned that day: clothes should never make the man or woman, because it is in fact the man or woman who makes the clothes. TRIIIBE’s work is so impacting because of reasons like this that can be relatable to anyone in many ways. I truly believe expressionist art like theirs will slowly, but surely morph society for the better.
