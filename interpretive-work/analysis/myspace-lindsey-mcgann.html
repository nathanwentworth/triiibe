	The photo “Myspace” by TRIIIBE is one of impact. A rebel teenager’s messy room is depicted in the frame, her annoyed glare towards her parents who stand talking in the corner. The image as a whole conveys the tension that can occur between young and old generations, not only in families, but in every part of the social world. Teens often find their ways to be better than their parents “outdated” ways of accomplishing things. They also struggle between the freedom of young adulthood and the confinements of still being legally a minor. Simultaneously, the adults of older generations often see those younger than them as reckless, and find new technologies such as social media unnerving because it is changing how we as a species communicate and interact. This type of tension is often seen as a common theme in any time period between the generations, and is considered normal by most people. The challenge of this convention is that we are all human. Even though each generation has its differences, we are all ultimately the same. This is portrayed by all three characters in the photo having the same face, as they are portrayed by the triplets that make up TRIIIBE.

	One of the first things I noticed while viewing the photo is the “Keep Right” sign on the wall of the bedroom. It peeks out amongst the photos, a little crooked in it’s placement. The sign’s phrase is ironic, as in the context of the room it suggests for the teen to keep on the “right” sort of path. However, the sign itself is a traffic sign, likely stolen from the road, and therefore has not been obtained by the “right” path it speaks of.

	The clothing of the parents in contrast to the room of the teen is also very apparent. Both mother and father have older styles of clothing, and both seem very conservative. This suggests a sort of intolerance to the more radical ideas of fashion and lifestyle many rebellious teens hold. The parents’ body language also tells a story. The mother’s concerned look and the way she is leaning towards her husband convey that she is looking to him for advice. The husband himself is looking towards the camera with a stern expression. His foot is standing on one of the many papers that are scattered on the floor. Both of these form a “I will not stand for this” sort of statement. The teen’s own expression as she casually looks up from a magazine to glare shows her defiance against the opinions of her parents.

	The room itself is separating the parents from their child, making the distance between them very deliberate and noticeable within the frame. The scattered clothes and papers throughout the room seem to clear off around the parents, exaggerating their more organized personalities and contrasting it with the teen’s own carelessness and her need to “find herself.” This space also shows the teen’s desire to be separated from her parents and have more independence. The sweatshirt hanging on the bedpost acts as a makeshift wall near the center of the image, showing more separation between the daughter and her parents.

	I personally find the image to be very relatable. I also think it is trying to make us look past the small differences between the generations and instead find similarities between the groups. It does this by using the three triplets that make up TRIIIBE as the characters. The faces of both the parents and the daughter are more similar than a normal family when you look closely. This can be seen as a portrayal of how each generation is the same, with the same tension between those that come before and after them. Even though this tension exists, they are all still human beings, and therefore have similarities coexisting with their differences.

	The title of the work is also a clever addition to the already impactful image. “Myspace” being a more recent form of media was often looked down upon by adults of the underaged users. This play on words create a perfect title for the image, as the teen is trying to create her own space in her room, but under the roof of her parents’ home. It shows the struggle between minor and adult as to who controls and ultimately owns the “space” that a teen occupies.

	Overall, the image itself has a very important and relatable concept. It conveys a struggle that the majority of people feel at some point in their lives as a minor and then again as they raise their own children. The concept makes viewers think about how similar the generations really are, even when it seems that they are from different worlds. It reminds them that petty things like clothing and differences in organization are not tall enough hurdles to build a “wall” from, but instead are small things that can be overlooked in order to get to common ground.
