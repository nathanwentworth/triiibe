		The “Right to Life” photo from the collection of <b>TRIIIBE: same difference</b> exhibition is a disconcerting photograph. In todays society just the words alone “right to life”, is a statement that generates ethical, moral and political debates. The collaboration of artists Alicia, Kelly, Sara Casilio and photographer Cary Molinsky visualize the statement “right to life” in their photograph. Their creativity and knowledge of design gives emphasis to this volatile social issue. the photograph places a young pregnant woman in an electrical chair. the white brick background gives a dungeon look of a prison cell. The priest and the guard are looking forward but off to the side and the woman is unemotionally looking directly forward. Their use of lighting creates defined shadows of darkness directing the eye of the viewer to the center of the photograph which focuses on the young women. I think the lighting gives depth to the photograph and controls the premise of the artists. the light also brings the viewers eye to the priest and the guard who both maybe representing different social issues of the “right to life.” In my thoughts, the priest represents the abortion issue; the child in the woman's womb, who has the right to live from the day of conception, illustrates the moral and religious debate of abortion. The guard represents the political issue of punishment and execution. Everyone has the right to life; liberty and the pursuit of happiness according to the Declaration of Independence. Do we have the right to punish by taking a life?

		This photograph, is a bold, political, moral, social statement. The viewer sees what is important to them; maybe it being the abortion issue or the right to life itself. In the photograph, the electrocution helmet device sits off to the left of her; it has not been placed on her head and is not plugged in; this may be the decision making of choosing to have an abortion or not.
