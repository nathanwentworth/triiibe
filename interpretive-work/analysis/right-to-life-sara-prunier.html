		“Right To Life”, like many of TRIIIBE’s other pieces, has several ways in which it can be interpreted. The most obvious themes are death and abortion. The image depicts a pregnant woman in an electrical chair with a cop standing to her right and a priest to her left. These two figures that are standing with the woman represent the separation of church and state when it comes to the debate on abortion. The image may also call upon the irony that people who are prolife are often also supportive of the death penalty. The image calls upon a conflict with these two viewpoints and makes you wonder if prolife and death penalty supporters would rethink their decisions if presented with this situation. Will the child get the right to life even though the mother is being executed? There is great difficulty in deciding another human beings fate whether it is an expecting mother or criminal.

		Another way to interpret this photo would be to focus on the woman’s appearance. She seems to be of lower or working class, giving the impression that having/supporting a child may be difficult. This causes the viewer to feel sympathy for her. She is also dressed in clothing that seems youthful, suggesting pregnancy at a young age. Given that she is sitting in an electrical chair, one could say that the image represents her pregnancy as a death of innocence.

		“Right To Life” was designed in a way that makes the image seem very dark. The somber lighting and cold concrete creates a depressing mood, while the expressionless men stand to the side of a pregnant woman sitting in an electrical chair connects to the harsh reality of the situation. The image is almost too uncomfortable to look at. A common theme with TRIIIBE’s work is that it creates a feeling of unrest. The viewer is turned off by what they are seeing which is the intended function of the design. This sense of unrest sparks the thought process – What is the artist trying to say? How does this image make me feel and why? This is the impact the image has on me personally. The image was initially shocking as the idea of a pregnant woman being executed is scary and gruesome; but the more I looked at the image the more the theme of abortion became evident. As I took the title of the image into consideration (“Right to Life”) I began questioning its relation to the image. Who is the artist trying to make this statement about? Does the woman deserve the right to life? Does the unborn child deserve this right? It was obvious that the image had a strong statement to make but depending on the viewer’s interpretation of the image, the statement has the ability to take many forms.

		At the very heart of the image is that each figure in the photo has the same face. The triplets, not only in “Right to Life” but also in all of TRIIIBE’s work, call upon the idea that at the end of the day we are all the same and that our current situation, appearance or any other factor of our identity doesn’t define our value as a human being.
