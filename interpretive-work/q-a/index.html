              <h1>Q&A With TRIIIBE</h1>
              <h2>by Kevin Fitzmaurice</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                  After we viewed the <b>TRIIIBE: same difference</b> exhibition, our team was left with some questions due to the compelling presentation of TRIIIBE’s work. Our team has collectively formulated answers to these questions based on information from TRIIIBE’s past interviews, and articles about their artwork. For TRIIIBE fans like us that still want to know more, we have included a list of our sources.
                </p>
                <h3>Where did the inspiration for TRIIIBE’s work come from?</h3>
                <p>
                  As identical triplets, sisters Alicia, Kelly, and Sara Casilio realized they never really had ownership of their own faces and could use themselves as a tool in artwork to make a statement about identity. When Cary met the Casilios he knew they were special. With Cary being a world-renowned National Geographic photographer, a dream team was forming. The Casilios and Cary wanted to inspire their audiences to dig deeper about serious issues of identity and politics.
                </p>
                <h3>What goes into naming a piece of work?</h3>
                <p>
                  The names of these pieces are so unique, but how does TRIIIBE decide which name fits? They start brainstorming ideas and the better ones begin to gravitate to the top, then they battle it out for which is better. Half the time they forget who originally came up with an idea because it is bounced around and critiqued so much. In an interview Cary mentions, “Titling is interesting because if you look at the file names for the original photographs, none of them are titles with what they are now, because as you are shooting the picture becomes something else and takes on a meaning.”
                </p>
                <h3>What do they hope their work accomplishes?</h3>
                <p>
                  Their art is a social experiment as they dissect identity. The sisters visually represent that at our cores we are alike. Some people tend to view triplets in a way that everything they do is alike and they share the same lives. To me, that is wrong. What the sisters do, is find an idea that engages an audience, then combine this with assumptions people make, and in return creates a powerful piece of work using their identical faces. The main intention for their work is to get people to see things for themselves instead of being told direct answers. This allows viewers to make their own assumptions. In Cary’s own words, from an interview with Arts and Ideas “you get down to this question of identity, especially in the political season when we start getting into our own tribes and start thinking as tribes and thinking the other guy is the bad guy and we are the good guy, that is the essence of all of these pictures.”
                </p>
                <h3>How does the thought process for an image begin?</h3>
                <p>
                  Sometimes it is something Cary had whipped up in his head that they work with and bounce off of one another. Other times it is an idea the Casilio’s are working on that they start discussing and see how it takes shape. The group likes to “navigate together.” A great example of all of this is In Search of Eden, in an interview with The Morning News Kelly Casilio explains, “The idea started was with the space we had. The space is an old Cadillac dealership, but it also looks really religious. So Alicia, Sara, and Marie Brown all came together and started coming up with ideas—triptychs, then we wanted to play off the story of Adam and Eve, and we wanted to play off apples. Then once that was all brought to Cary, he sat and sketched up ideas for all these triptychs. Then we picked from his ideas, applied apples, and worked from there.”
                </p>
                <h3>What's it like growing up as identical triplets?</h3>
                <p>
                  Growing up the sisters shared a bedroom. Their mother taught art classes and their father a software engineer. They clearly inherited their mother’s creativity and their fathers attention to detail. High school was the peak of the sisters trying to be different, Kelly was goth, Alicia was a hippie, and Sara was punk; but regardless they still were just called “Casilio”. After high school the sisters enrolled at Mass Art all with different majors, but soon found themselves working on similar ideas and going to one another for critiques on their work. Just being together attracted lots of attention and “a walking performance.” Eventually the Casilio’s decided to embrace this rather than search for something else. Cary Wolinsky really admires how well the three work together, mentioning how they have such a feel for each other’s sensitivities. Today’s culture is so much about being different from one another and individuality that the artwork of <b>TRIIIBE: same difference</b> has a unique way of challenging that idea and bringing it to surface. In addition, the three represent a relationship with each other and share a deeper understanding of one another that most would strive to have. Of course just like most siblings they argue, and because they do not all think and act exactly alike it really gets to people. This vision of identical siblings finishing each other’s sentences and always agree on things but when you experience this firsthand and realize that it is not always how it is, that idea challenges people. Like something they have never seen before and they are fascinated by it. Being different and dressing different for TRIIIBE really messes with people, making this such a powerful exhibit. Cary shared a story in the magazine article “Tripling” by Nozlee Samadzadeh about when he was a young boy his best friends were twins. ”I noticed that this phenomenon right through my childhood: I was always walking around with these celebrities. Why they were celebrities? I don’t know! Just that people thought that since they were twins, somehow that made them special. And it did! It affected them and their behavior and gave, them to my mind, a magical power.”
                </p>
                <h3>Is it difficult for the collective to work together?</h3>
                <p>
                  The heart of TRIIIBE’s art making process is collaboration and feedback. For the Casilio’s in addition to creating art they work together in a design department of a software company in Lexington. Cary works the opposite way as the sisters do, they start with concepts and he starts with a vision. Wolinsky admires the Casilios’ attention to detail and tenacious research, and he applauds their bravery. Cary mentioned no matter who started with a first idea, there has not been a single project that ended up looking exactly the way they imagined it would look. The ability to listen to one another and be open to change and ideas, and everyone’s wide range of skills makes their artwork so successful. Working off one another and bouncing ideas to create art so powerful for their audience.
                </p>
                <h3>How did the four end up grouping up to make such a special and powerful artwork?</h3>
                <p>
                  Cary Wolinsky was at a retirement party for a sculptor at the campus of Massachusetts College of Art where the Casilio sisters had attended. The retiring sculptor; George Greenamyer has a snowy beard, and always wears overalls. While Wolinsky was at the party he noticed that Greenamyer had walked in, then another Greenamyer, and another. The only issue was it was not Greenamyer at all, it was the Casilio sisters. After the party Wolinsky reached out to the sisters and set up a dinner meeting. There they decided to collaborate.
