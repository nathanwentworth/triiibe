<h1 style="text-align: center;">FAM’s Annual Art in Bloom Has Done It Again,<br>
This Time With a Twist</h1>
<h2>by Kim Tecce and Jackie Brown</h2>

  On the weekend of April 8th 2016, Fitchburg Art Museum hosted the Laurelwood Garden Club’s annual event Art In Bloom. FAM invited the garden club to incorporate a little bit of nature throughout the museum, making a selection of photographs, paintings, and sculptures from FAM’s current exhibitions available for Laurelwood to interpret in flowers. The opening celebration was accompanied by live music, spirits and hors d'oeuvres, which provided an upbeat and welcoming atmosphere for FAM’s guests. Art in Bloom is an event that gives the definition of art the opportunity to branch out into a whole new meaning due to the fact that FAM typically showcases a range of contemporary and historical artwork such as paintings or photos, but here Art in Bloom proves that an artist does not have to hold a paintbrush or a camera in order to create a work of art. The members of the Laurelwood Garden Club each made a floral bouquet to represent the artwork in a way that strikes conversation, just as TRIIIBE’s work has done.

  When looking at the bouquets it was interesting to see that Lucille Maynard’s interpretative bouquet of 3 Mil Plastics appeared to be a direct interpretation of the subject of the photograph. Starting at the top of the bouquet the sea star ferns are being used as the models hair. The calla lilies could be interpreted as the rest of her face moving into the purple flowers, which one could interpret as her eyes or even the earrings that catch the viewer's eyes at first glance. Maynard’s big give away would be the red flower. In the viewer’s eyes this correlates beautifully with the main attraction of the photo which would be the model’s lipstick. This bouquet interpretation captures the beauty that the photo represents but also caught the morbidity of it as well. As you move down to the vase, Maynard didn’t shy away from the use of covering or webbing like the model who is wrapped in the photograph. In many ways we think of bodies wrapped in plastic relating to body bags, but in this bouquet Maynard takes a different look at the wrap and makes it an elegant dressing to the bouquet to tie it all together.

  Sarah Grant’s bouquet interpretation of TRIIIBE’s Table for 3 is a very intricate bouquet that even uses props to help convey her message.  When looking at Grant’s interpretation, the chalice cup in the middle corresponding with the Christian priest in the middle of TRIIIBE’s photograph was an interesting point to start. It was believed that when Christianity began to rise the calla lily represented chastity, virtue and purity, and was associated with the Virgin Mary. It is in this example that you can see that nothing was done by accident in these displays – all the placements of the flowers and props were done deliberately to convey Grant’s message. When comparing the rest of the photo to the bouquet one would believe that the vase to the left represents Judaism, and the one to the right can represent the Muslim religion as well. Grant also uses props such as glasses, jewelry and writing utensils to display the religions coming together on commonalities that we as humans all face no matter where we come from. A quote from Grant on her piece sums it up quite nicely: “A rabbi, a priest, and an imam come to the table: we will pine, sign and dine together.”

  Laurelwood Garden Club member and FAM Trustee Achla Bahl Madan interpreted TRIIIBE’s Compatibility Quiz. The depiction of the photo shown in the floral bouquet got right to the point. Madan reflected each of the photo’s subjects in a way that was both efficient and straightforward. It is safe to say that this floral bouquet was one to catch the eye. In whole, the theme of the photo absolutely carried over in Madan’s work. The arrangement was made up of three parts. Each consisted of a bouquet of flowers paired with a vase, a bottle of alcohol, and decorated with accessories to mimic each subject’s individualistic style.

  Madan’s florals echo the setting and the opposing subjects of Compatibility Quiz with the appropriate use of color, material and decoration. Each third of the floral work of art resembles one of three subjects in TRIIIBE’s photo. The left bouquet copies the style of the blonde woman on the far left in the photo. It holds red flowers, which represent the red top and red lipstick worn by the woman. The vase appears to be dressed like the subject’s bottom-half, while the bouquet of red flowers held inside seems to represent her top-half.  Decorated to look like the lace tights and black skirt worn in the photo, the vase accurately matches the left woman’s style. The bouquet in the middle is much more bland than the other two, similar to the style of the middle subject in the photo compared with the other two styles. The vase is solid black with a strip of silver along the bottom edge. It embraces a bouquet of leaves and a pair of twigs which are dressed in a pearl necklace like the one worn by the photo’s middle subject. Lastly, the right portion of Madan’s piece features lilac colored flowers and a solid black vase to present the style of the woman on the right in Compatibility Quiz. The outfit worn by the woman on the right strikes notice – her style is bold and less color-coordinated than the other two women to her right. Madan symbolizes this style with her use of peculiar shaped twigs and disordered ornamentation of random articles such as straw and vine.

  With each bouquet, a bottle is placed accordingly to represent the setting and the subject’s apparent drink of choice. From left to right, Madan has placed a bottle of what appears to be whiskey, wine and rum with the corresponding bouquet. This makes it easier for the audience to interpret the personalities of the artwork. Madan mimics the views of society, just like the subjects do in Compatibility Quiz. By pairing a particular alcohol with each piece, Madan successfully expressed society’s idea of the subject’s personality. Generally, society associates certain drink orders with individual style, for instance wine is more often associated with women as is beer with men.

  Kathy Foster made a beautiful floral interpretation of TRIIIBE’s Fine. TRIIIBE’s photo almost washes out its three subjects by matching one pattern across every included element. The wallpaper matches the floor, which matches the couch, which matches the dresses that match the shoes. Three women each wearing different hairstyles and different dresses and shoes of the same pattern sit centered in the photo. Foster had an interesting reading of Fine, “like 3 French poodles taken from the wild and lost in an upholstered trophy room. 3 racy manes, reduced and tamed. 3 tussie-mussies, gussied and fussy.”

  Foster was able to represent TRIIIBE’s photo in her work by including an identical color scheme in her bouquet and a symmetrical decorated flower box. The flower box appears to consist of three separate sections, representing the three subjects. The colors of the various flowers make a continuous pattern for the eye, creating the illusion that it is one piece rather than three. The floral bouquet Foster made had evident success with mimicking the style and creating a similar feel as TRIIIBE’s Fine.

  The members of Laurel Garden Club magnificently paired each piece in FAM with an inspired floral bouquet. Each individually complemented the chosen piece in Fitchburg Art Museum and the event overall was a success for the 11th year in a row. If you were not able to make it, mark your calendars now for next year’s Art in Bloom so you can experience the beauty for yourself!
